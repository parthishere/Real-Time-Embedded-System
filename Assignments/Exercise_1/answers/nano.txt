POSIX Clock demo using system RT clock with resolution:
	0 secs, 0 microsecs, 1 nanosecs

RT clock start seconds = 1639128065, nanoseconds = 449800452
RT clock stop seconds = 1639128068, nanoseconds = 450002898
RT clock DT seconds = 3, nanoseconds = 202446
Requested sleep seconds = 3, nanoseconds = 0

Sleep loop count = 1
RT clock delay error = 0, nanoseconds = 202446
